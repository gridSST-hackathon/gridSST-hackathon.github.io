# About


The goal of this hackathon is to kickstart the development of a new open-source algorithm, designed to run on cloud-enabled computing platforms, that will merge multiple remotely-sensed data streams to produce an ultra-high resolution, gap-free gridded sea surface temperature product.  This event will bring together a diverse group of experts from several different scientific and technical domains, including satellite remote sensing, physical oceanography, cloud computing, and data science and machine learning. Participants from a variety of research interests and experience levels are welcome to register!

To best benefit from and contribute to the hackathon, participants should have basic experience with Python.  Participants should familiarize themselves with the materials included in [Python novice gapminder](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) and [Python novice inflammation](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/).
