## About

The goal of this hackathon is to kickstart the development of a new open-source algorithm, designed to run on cloud-enabled computing platforms, that will merge multiple remotely-sensed data streams to produce an ultra-high resolution, gap-free gridded sea surface temperature product.  This event will bring together a diverse group of experts from several different scientific and technical domains, including satellite remote sensing, physical oceanography, cloud computing, and data science and machine learning. 

This 5-day event will be held at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA, October 31 to November 4, 2022.

## What is a Hackathon?

In simple terms, a hackathon is an event where programmers from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds collaborate to "hack" or code together a project or application in a limited amount of time. The hackathon environment leads participants to collaborate intensively on hands-on projects and encourages the pursuit of creative solutions towards project goals. 


Hack week events are similar to hackathons and are more oriented towards the learning experience, often offering programming tutorials alongside collaborative hackathon-style projects. The hack week model has been successfully deployed at the University of Washington in Seattle across a variety of disciplines, including _[Ocean-](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/index.html)_, _[Water-](https://waterhackweek.github.io/), [Geo-](https://geohackweek.github.io/)_, _[Neuro-](https://neurohackademy.org/)_, and _[Astrohackweek](http://astrohackweek.org/2022/)_.
