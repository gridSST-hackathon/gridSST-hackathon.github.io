# Apply


The 5-day event will take place at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA, and will have a virtual component for remote participants to be held 9 AM to 5 PM PT. Travel funds and lodgings are available for applicants coming from within the U.S. Applicants will be notified of decisions by October 1. 

The focus of this hackathon is to kickstart the development of a new open-source algorithm, designed to run on cloud-enabled computing platforms, that will merge multiple remotely-sensed data streams to produce an ultra-high resolution, gap-free gridded sea surface temperature product. This will largely be done in **Python**, an open-source, functional programming language utilized in the development of many current scientific softwares and algorithms. To best benefit from and contribute to the hackathon, participants should have basic experience with Python. Participants should familiarize themselves with the materials included in the following two Software Carpentry Python lessons: 

- [Python novice gapminder](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) 
- [Python novice inflammation](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/).
