## Jupyter notebooks and the Jupyter ecosystem

You may have heard of [Jupyter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter) -- an open computing "ecosystem" developed by [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org). This ecosystem is described succinctly and effectively in [the online open book, Teaching and Learning with Jupyter](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/):

> Project Jupyter is three things: a collection of standards, a community, and a set of software tools. Jupyter Notebook, one part of Jupyter, is software that creates a Jupyter notebook. A Jupyter notebook is a document that supports mixing executable code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Specifically, Jupyter notebooks allow the user to bring together data, code, and prose, to tell an interactive, computational story. ([*"2.2 But first, what is Jupyter Notebook?"*](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/why-we-use-jupyter-notebooks.html#but-first-what-is-jupyter-notebook))

See the [resources at the end of this page](#references-and-resources).


## Why use a shared cloud computing environment?

Collaborating on programming projects with a diverse group of coders across multiple different systems can be a challenge. One solution is to invite all participants to work in a cloud computing environment that is pre-configured for the specific software we will deploy. This cloud computing instance can be accessed from any web browser, which eliminates the need for configuring each person's individual computer. For this hackathon we have created virtual computing instances that can be deployed on demand in a parallel computing environment. We use JupyterHub as a way to give a Jupyter Notebook server ([JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) to each person in a group. JupyterHub enables us to quickly begin working with code without spending time to get the necessary libraries and dependencies set up on everyone's individual computers.

We encourage you to use our shared JupyterHub resources for your projects. We also hope you will practice installing Python libraries locally on your system so that you can continue working after leaving our event.



## How do I access the shared cloud environment?

The shared cloud environment (JupyterHub) can be accessed here: [https://gridsst.2i2c.cloud/](https://gridsst.2i2c.cloud/)

After opening the above link, click "Log in to continue", then click "Sign in with GitHub" to grant JupyterHub the required permissions. In the next window, enter your GitHub username (or email address) and password. 

You will then see a message that says "Your server is starting up." It will take a bit of time for this to load - be patient! Once things are spun up you will see your very own instance of a [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) graphical user interface.
