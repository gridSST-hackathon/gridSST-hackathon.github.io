## Logistics

This event will be held as a hybrid event, with an in-person portion held in Seattle, Washington, and a virtual component held via Zoom. Hybrid events have become increasingly widespread in recent years, and all participants are encouraged to participate to the fullest of their abilities regardless of their status as an in-person or virtual participant. Communication will largely be held via Slack and project collaboration will be done on GitHub.

## In-Person Event
The in-person portion of the Grid SST Hackathon will be held at the **Washington Park Arboretum's Wisteria Hall in Seattle, Washington.** The event will begin at **9:00 AM Pacific Time** at this location, Monday through Friday during the week of October 31st. Breakfast and lunch will be provided on location. Transportation from the University of Washington campus and the Watertown Hotel is currently being organized; more details will be provided near the start of the event. 

## Virtual Event
Virtual participants are invited to attend the Grid SST Hackathon through Zoom at the same time as the in-person event, **9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Pacific Time,** Monday through Friday during the week of October 31st. Virtual participants hold as much value to this event as those joining us in person, and are strongly encouraged to engage with all events on the Hackathon schedule, as well as communicate and collaborate with the event organizers and fellow participants through Slack, Zoom, and GitHub. More details about how to connect via Zoom will be provided near the start of the event.
