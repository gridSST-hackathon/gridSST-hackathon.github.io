# Grid SST Hackathon


The Grid SST Hackathon is a 5-day event to be held at the University of Washington in Seattle and virtually on **October 31 through November 4, 2022.** The goal of this 5-day event is to kickstart development of a new, community-created, open-source and cloud-based algorithm to blend multiple remotely-sensed SST data streams into a global, 1-km, daily, gridded product. 

Participants from a variety of research interests and backgrounds, including satellite remote sensing, physical oceanography, cloud computing, and data science and machine learning, are encouraged to apply. We are planning for a hands-on, productive, and fun-filled week!  


Travel funds and lodgings are available for applicants coming from within the U.S.  Applicants will be notified of decisions by October 1.

## The Challenge

High resolution sea surface temperatures (SST) are a critical climate data record. Most existing approaches developed by the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) were developed over a decade ago and depend on the transfer of vast amounts of satellite data to local data centers with appropriate cyberinfrastructure. 

The overarching goal and challenge of this hackathon is to create a new global, 1 km, daily, community-created open science blended SST analysis. The intended outcomes of this event are to re-imagine how a high temporal (daily), high spatial (1 km) SST dataset could be produced using passive microwave and infrared satellite SST data. Code and products developed within this event will be open to the scientific community and hosted on GitHub. The global, daily, 1 km dataset output will be in both GHRSST GDS2.0 netCDF4 and Zarr formats.
