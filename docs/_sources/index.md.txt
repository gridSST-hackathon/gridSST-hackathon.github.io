# Grid SST Hackathon

 



The Grid SST Hack-A-Thon is a 5-day event to be held at the University of Washington in Seattle and virtually on **October 31 through November 4, 2022.** The goal of this 5-day event is to kickstart development of a new, community-created, open-source and cloud-based algorithm to blend multiple remotely-sensed SST data streams into a global, 1-km, daily, gridded product. 

We are planning for a hands-on, productive, and fun-filled week, so we sincerely hope that you are able to join us!  

The event will be happening at 9 AM to 5 PM PST October 31 through November 4. If you can't join us in Seattle, you can still participate virtually!
