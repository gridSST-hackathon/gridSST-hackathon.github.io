# What is a Hackathon?

In simple terms, a hackathon is an event where programmers from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds collaborate to "hack" or code together a project or application in a limited amount of time. The hackathon environment leads participants to collaborate intensively on hands-on projects and encourages the pursuit of creative solutions towards project goals. 


Hack week events are similar to hackathons and are more oriented towards the learning experience, often offering programming tutorials alongside collaborative hackathon-style projects. The hack week model has been successfully deployed at the University of Washington in Seattle across a variety of disciplines, including _[Ocean-](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/index.html)_, _[Water-](https://waterhackweek.github.io/), [Geo-](https://geohackweek.github.io/)_, _[Neuro-](https://neurohackademy.org/)_, and _[Astrohackweek](http://astrohackweek.org/2022/)_.
