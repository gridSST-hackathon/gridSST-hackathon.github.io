# SST

The focus of this hackathon is to create a new global, 1 km, daily, community-created open science blended SST analysis. High resolution sea surface temperatures (SST) are a critical climate data record and many existing approaches have been developed by the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST). Below are some resources about SST.
