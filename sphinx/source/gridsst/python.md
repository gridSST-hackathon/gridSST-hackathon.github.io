## Python 

The focus of this hackathon is to kickstart the development of a new open-source algorithm, designed to run on cloud-enabled computing platforms, that will merge multiple remotely-sensed data streams to produce an ultra-high resolution, gap-free gridded sea surface temperature product. 

This will largely be done in **Python**, an open-source, functional programming language utilized in the development of many current scientific softwares and algorithms. While we anticipate that most participants will have some experience with Python or other programming languages, we understand that everyone joining the Grid SST Hackathon is coming from a variety of different backgrounds and skill levels in programming. The material covered in the links provided below should be enough to refresh your Python skills.
